# Fashion-MNIST-classifier
CNN model using Fashion MNIST dataset in PyTorch

## Description
This project is an implementation of the TinyVGG architecture using PyTorch. TinyVGG is a simplified version of the VGG network, designed for small-scale image classification tasks. I think it's a great starting point for beginners in deep learning and computer vision. This implementation was developed using Google Colab and leverages CUDA for accelerated GPU computations.
